# Nsolver
OSINT tool that can be used to retrieve information from a list of domains/subdomains. Useful to determine the ownership of public assets. 

Given a list of domains and subdomanis, the tool extracts and presents the following information in a CSV file:
DNS A Records
DNS AAAA Records
DNS CNAME Records
SSL Certificate CN

## Upcoming Changes:
- The tool will be expanded to include an initial subdomain enumeration.
- Better layout and more information printed on screen.
